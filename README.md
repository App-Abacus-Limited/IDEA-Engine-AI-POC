<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

The IDEA Engine stands as a beacon for global knowledge and prosperity enhancement. It's not just a platform; it's a movement that categorizes its vast community into three distinct segments: individuals, communities, and businesses.

At its core, the IDEA Engine empowers every member. Whether you're nurturing a fresh idea or advancing an existing project, the platform's AI-driven technology is designed to propel you forward, regardless of whether the project is personal, communal, or business-oriented.

Central to the IDEA Engine is the Universal Data Lake using Azure, Microsoft Fabric, Semantic Kernel including a comprehensive repository using Microsoft Graph connecting individual, communities and businesses. This seamlessly integrates with the Actcentive brand e-commerce marketplace, a dynamic space that harnesses the power of affiliate marketing, social media, and more to generate revenue. While Actcentive remains an integral part of this ecosystem, further details on its operation and benefits will be elaborated upon in subsequent sections.

The platform's heartbeat is its array of Large Language Models (LLMs), Small Language Models (SLMs) and Large Action Models (LAMs). These AI models, tailored for a specific domain and platform workflows, drawing inspiration from cutting-edge research projects. The spectrum of models spans from renowned ones like OpenAI's GPT4 to open-source solutions and internal proprietary models developed using C# ML.NET and Rust. The software architecture is based on a number of opensource projects Microsoft AutoGen, ChatDev, Aider, Huggingface Candle.

Every project on the IDEA Engine is unique, and the platform acknowledges this. Depending on project specifics such as geographical location, category (individual, community, business), and sector, it undergoes a tailored workflow, ensuring optimal results.

## Development Concept

At a very high level, IDEA Engine AI is about providing a complete and common system architecture for high-performing desktop, mobile, and cloud applications with Rust.

Why? Because we think Rust is a transformative language, environment, and ecosystem that provides the necessary building blocks for building next generation desktop, mobile, and cloud applications.

The "Cargo" way to think about it, is that IDEA Engine AI is about making desktop, mobile, and cloud Cargo features. 

Our aim is to develop from the ground up new solution using Rust, Tauri, Native Web Components, and SurrealDB.

### Powering the IDEA Engine is a robust technological foundation:

- Cloud and AI Services: Microsoft Azure, Azure OpenAI, Azure Machine Learning
- Azure Kubernetes microservice architecture using Docker containers  
- Databases: Surreal Db, Qdrant, Azure Redis
- Web Services: Azure web app service (Linux, NGINX)
- Development Frameworks: Rust, Python, JavaScript, NodeJS, TypeScript, ASP. NET CORE 8.0, .NET MAUI .NET 8.0, .NET Blazor,
  			.NET 8.0, ML.NET, Microsoft Semantic Kernel, Microsoft CoPilot's, OpenAI, Stability AI
- Programming Languages: Rust, Python, C#, TypeScript, JavaScript
- AI Libraries: Huggingface, OpenAI, Azure
- Collaboration Tools: GitHub, GitHub Copilot, GitHub Copilot Chat
- IDEs: Visual Studio 2022, VS Code

This list, while extensive, is just the tip of the iceberg. The IDEA Engine is an amalgamation of these technologies, each playing a pivotal role in shaping the platform.

The platform's initial development phase zeroes in on the IDEA Engine Coder project. Drawing inspiration from a plethora of open-source projects on GitHub, the objective is clear: forge a groundbreaking platform using the synergies of Rust, Microsoft .NET MAUI, Blazor, C#, Python, and Azure technologies. The future of development is here, and it's powered by the IDEA Engine.

## Git LFS
We use Git LFS for dependencies that are expensive to build.

To make sure you have everything you need to start building, you'll need to
install the `git-lfs` package for your favourite operating system, then run the
following commands in this repo:

``` PowerShell
git lfs install
git lfs pull
```
## Development Requirements

CMake
https://cmake.org/download/

## Open Source Project
A list of the open source projects GitHub repos being used as inspiration:

Microsoft Semantic Kernel will be used to manage the AI planner, agent, persona and other aspects of the AI LLM infrastructure:
https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel

https://github.com/microsoft/chat-copilot

https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-memory

https://github.com/Azure-Samples/miyagi

Development tools to inspire the IDEA Engine coder project. The goal is to develop an end to end development project lifecycle solution that uses both Visual Studio, VSCode and the IDEA Engines UI to manage the coding aspect of a project. These are a few of the open source projects that will be used to build the overall IDEA Engine Coder solution:

### Platform Agents

The platforms community membership aspect includes individual personalised models that are allowed to communicate as agents with each other throughout the community. This concept requires additional research and details to be defined. The overall concept is based on the Generative Agent concept (GitHub rep link below):
